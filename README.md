Sorting Visualizer

Overview

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application that visually demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work. The project is designed to help users understand and compare the functionality of popular sorting algorithms through animations and step-by-step visual explanations.

Features

Interactive and intuitive interface.

Visual representation of the following sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Adjustable speed and array size.

Real-time animation of sorting operations.

Option to pause, reset, or restart the visualization.

Sorting Algorithms

1. Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(1)

2. Selection Sort

Selection Sort divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted region and moves it to the end of the sorted region.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(1)

3. Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(1)

4. Merge Sort

Merge Sort uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It recursively splits the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

5. Quick Sort

Quick Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average, O(n^2) in the worst case

Space Complexity: O(log n)

6. Heap Sort

Heap Sort involves building a max-heap (or min-heap) from the array, then repeatedly removing the largest (or smallest) element from the heap and rebuilding it.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

How to Use

Clone or download the repository.

Open the project in your preferred code editor.

Run the application locally using a live server or host it on a web server.

Use the interface to:

Adjust array size and sorting speed.

Select a sorting algorithm from the list.
